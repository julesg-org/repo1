Welcome to a REPRODUCIBLE Underworld project

This is a template git repository for creating REPRODUCIBLE Underworld code based projects.

REPRODUCIBLE because this project:
1. Is kept in a git repository.
2. Uses a Dockerfile to recreate the exact project environment.

With the 2 features above the project can be enhanced by a number of software engineering and open source principles, such as:
_version control_, _reproducible environments_, _collaboration_ (Pull Requests, Binderhub), _continuous integration_. (For a simple general introduction to these principle we recommend https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/, not it's data-science focussed)  

*Welcome to the future of Underworld community projects.*
